# Overview


This software tracks the users emotional state from 1-10 over the course of weeks. The user can add a new emotional update, look back at previous days, and find their average emotional state.

This software was a practice to learn Kotlin, as well as a first attempt at building something that may develop into a full app.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
